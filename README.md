# rust-weechat-remote
Rust wrapper for the WeeChat remote protocol.


The [WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) IRC client provides a [protocol](https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_relay_protocol.en.html) to remotely access a running instance of the program. This library aims to implement a wrapper for this protocol to safely use it in user remote programs.

This is my first Rust project, so expect rough edges and dragons.
